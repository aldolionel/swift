## Task

1. Suppose you have many features to consider, but you can't use all of them directly because of computational cost. What are the possible things you can do
under this circumstances?
2. Suppose you have 10000 close-up images of people's faces; each with its gender label. You used all the labeled images to train a gender classifier model. After
you created the model, you tested the accuracy using the training data and you got a very good accuracy. You feel happy (: Unfortunately... when you deploy it
to production, the accuracy drops considerably. What are the possible causes to such problem? What will you then propose to handle them?
3. Do you think the feature engineering stage is generally more important or the algorithm stage (model selection, training, hyperparameter tuning)?
4. We throw 8 dice and take the sum of the highest 4 outcomes. What is the probability that the sum equals to 24?
5. We throw a die 10000 times and record the sum of the outcomes. Approximate the probability that the sum is in the range of [34500, 35500]. (The
approximation must be within $\pm$0.03%
